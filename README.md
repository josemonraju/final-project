# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project: Python

## Project due date: 7/23/2020, at 5:00 PM EST
## You must be available during the class time to present your project.

#### Presentation structure (7-10 min)
- Share your URL
- What is your project?
- Demo
- What were the hurdles (Perhaps technology issues)? 
- Any advice that you can give to your classmates
- QA

#### Overview
Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern application using Python.
You must submit your full project proposal and dataset to your instructional team by 6:00 PM EST Thursday (7/16/2020).
Show us what you've got!

NOTE: Send us a Slack DM message, CC: Britt, Vonn, and Suresh

## Requirements

#### Standard Python project must:
- Be a working, interactive, Python application
- Must consist of GOOD OOP design
- Must at least 3 classes
- Must include public, private variables
- You may use files, or dictionaries as storage unit
- Must use any third party libraries such as request, PrettyTable, colored

#### Data Science project must:
- Be a working, interactive, Python application
- Must include grouping and data aggregation, and standard functions such as max, min, sum, and std etc
- Must have at least 2 .apply methods()
- Must have data visualization 

NOTE: ***YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RECREATE PROJECT 1 OR PROJECT 2***

#### Your code must:
- Be properly indented  
- Be written with semantic Python code  
- Be commented for the other developers    

## Necessary Deliverables

#### A Killer Project Proposal:
- What is your project is all about
- What are the three classes (or more), be ready to discuss it's functionality
- If it's Data Science project, you must provide the link to the data set prior to the project approval

#### For the project:
- Regadless of your what type of application you intend to build it must have a GitHub repo(USE YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB REPO)
- Data Science project must include the dataset in the GitHub repo along with the Jupyter Notebook
- DO NOT UPLOAD THE PROJECT FILES TO GITHUB, you must push your code the GitHub as you build the application

## Getting Unstuck

* **Don't hesitate to write messy code to solve short-term problems**&mdash;***Refactor later***
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use**. The docs often include a tutorial that can help you get started, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.

## Asking For Help

#### Maximizing Effectiveness of Support Sessions
We ***strongly recommend*** that you have the following,
  1. A code snippet
  2. A precise and specific description of your issue
  3. What error you got
  4. What you already tried to resolve your error and the result of those attempts

We also strongly recommend **using Slack to get help from your classmates** and use ***Stackoverflow***. Chances are you'll will be running into similar problems.

## A Note on Plagiarism
Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/PYTH-5-19/final-project/blob/master/Plagiarism.MD), specifically on using work you find online and on work you do with other students.
